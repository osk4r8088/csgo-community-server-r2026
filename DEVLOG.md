## v1.0 — Initial Multi-Mode Server (2026-03-10 to 2026-03-13)

### Timeline

**Day 1 (2026-03-10): Docker to Host**
- Started with Docker-based srcds. Spent 2 hours debugging Steam authentication.
- `SteamAPI_Init() failed; create pipe failed` — Docker's IPC isolation breaks Steam's client library. `ipc:host`, `privileged`, shared `/tmp` , nothing worked
- Abandoned Docker entirely. Installed srcds directly on host at `/srv/csgo-host/`.
- App ID patching: SteamCMD installs app 730, but the 2026 client expects 4465480. Must patch `steam.inf` and `steam_appid.txt`.
- NoLobbyReservation: The original vanz666 repo has outdated gamedata signatures. The eldoradoel fork has working ones. Without this plugin, clients get infinite "Retrying..." with no error message.
- First successful client connection after patching app ID + installing NoLobbyReservation.

**Day 2 (2026-03-11): Multi-Mode Foundation**
- Created `start.sh` with mode-based plugin activation system.
- Moved all mode-specific plugins to `plugins/disabled/`. Each boot activates only what's needed.
- Created per-mode configs: `surf.cfg`, `kz.cfg`, `dm.cfg`, `arena.cfg`, `retake.cfg`.
- Discovered `+servercfgfile` (not `+exec`) is the correct way to load per-mode configs.
- Discovered `game_type 3 game_mode 0` (Custom) avoids engine-forced casual behaviors (auto-bots, warmup extension, unwanted map votes). Used for surf, kz, arena.

**Day 3 (2026-03-12): Plugins + Database**
- Installed SurfTimer v1.1.4. Required MySQL — SQLite is explicitly unsupported.
- MariaDB 10.11 installed on VPS. User creation hit bash history expansion (`!` in password triggered `!V` expansion). Fixed by removing `!` from password.
- MySQL socket vs TCP: `localhost` in databases.cfg uses Unix socket (`/tmp/mysql.sock` which doesn't exist). Changed to `127.0.0.1` to force TCP.
- `lib32z1` required for SourceMod's MySQL extension (32-bit `libz.so.1`).
- SurfTimer tables not auto-created — had to manually import `fresh_install.sql` from the release ZIP.
- GOKZ v3.6.4 + MovementAPI v2.4.3 installed. KZ works flawlessly out of the box.
- `gokz-momsurffix` exists but causes `CheckParameters` error spam — not activated.
- Added `gokz-saveloc` (checkpoints!), `gokz-goto`, `gokz-spec`, `gokz-pistol`, `gokz-chat`.

**Day 4 (2026-03-13): Skins, Modeswitch, Polish**
- PTaH v1.1.4 installed. Extension named `PTaH.ext.2.csgo.so` (SourceMod auto-detects the `.2.csgo` suffix).
- kgns/weapons provides both `!ws` AND `!knife` in a single plugin. No separate `knife.smx` exists.
- Skin plugins need `"storage-local"` database entry in databases.cfg (uses SQLite).
- Plugin filename casing matters on Linux: `SurfTimer.smx` (not `surftimer.smx`), `movementapi.smx` (not `MovementAPI.smx`).
- Modeswitch plugin rewritten from v1 (hot-swap) to v3 (restart-based + rotation + vote):
  - v1 tried to `sm plugins load/unload` at runtime → cvars persist, game_type can't change, broken.
  - v2 used file-based IPC + `ServerCommand("quit")` → wrapper auto-restarts with new mode.
  - v3 added auto-rotation (maps-played counter per mode) + democratic vote + periodic tips.
- `!mode` renamed to `!modes` to avoid conflict with GOKZ's `!mode` (which switches KZ movement modes).
- `!modes` changed from `RegConsoleCmd` to `RegAdminCmd` — prevents any player from triggering server restarts.
- DM game_type experiment: Changed to `game_type 3` for config control, but this broke DM spawn behavior (spawns in normal CT/T spawns instead of DM spawns). Reverted to `game_type 1 game_mode 2`.
- Retake game_type experiment: Tried `game_type 3`, but the retake plugin needs competitive round structure. Reverted to `game_type 0 game_mode 1`. Retake is still partially broken (warmup doesn't exit with bots).
- SourceMod file write issue: `OpenFile("/srv/csgo/.pendingmode", "w")` fails — SM sandboxes file access. Even absolute paths under the game dir fail. Solution: `BuildPath(Path_SM, path, sizeof(path), "data/pendingmode.txt")` — writes to SM's own data directory.

## v1.1 — Chat Voting, Ramp Fix, Map Expansion (2026-03-15)

### Changes

**Modeswitch v4.1 — Chat-based voting**
- Complete rewrite of voting system. Regular players no longer get menus (accidental key presses during gameplay).
- `!switchmode` — RTV-style: 60% of players must request it, then mode options are listed in chat. Players vote by typing `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.
- `!modes` — Admin only: menu-based direct switch or `!modes <name>` for instant switch.
- Removed `!currentmode` and `!modemenu` commands.
- Vote numbers are suppressed from chat (clean output).
- All vote state resets on map change (fixes stuck vote bug from v3).
- Disconnecting players properly decrement the switchmode request count.
- Auto-rotation after map limit uses the same chat vote system.

**MomSurfFix v2 (GAMMACASE fork)**
- Fixes engine's `ClipVelocity` bug that causes speed loss on ramps.
- Activated for both surf and kz modes via start.sh.
- `gokz-momsurffix` (standalone) was NOT used — it caused `CheckParameters` error spam.

**Retake fix**
- `mp_maxrounds 999` (was `0`) — prevents engine from ending the match immediately.
- `mp_match_can_clinch 0` — prevents early match end.
- `mp_do_warmup_period 0` — skip warmup entirely, retakes plugin handles player readiness.
- Downloaded pre-made spawn configs from splewis/csgo-retakes for all 5 retake maps.
- Kept `game_type 0 game_mode 1` (competitive) — Custom mode breaks the retakes plugin's round restart logic.

**Map expansion**
- KZ: added kz_layercake, kz_dale, kz_dejavu, kz_rise, kz_variety_fix (removed phantom maps that were never downloaded).
- Surf: added surf_deteriorate, surf_nuclear, surf_boreas, surf_whiteout (removed phantom maps).
- de_cache added to competitive and DM map pools.
- All mapcycle files and modeswitch_maps.cfg cleaned to match actual VPS maps.

**Arena fix**
- Removed `bot_quota 1` from arena.cfg (was stealing a player slot).
- Set `bot_quota 0`, `mp_do_warmup_period 0`.

**Tips system**
- Added mode-specific tips: `!start !end !nc` for surf/kz, `!guns` for retake.
- Updated universal tips to reference `!switchmode` instead of `!modes`.

## Architecture Decisions

### Why restart-based mode switching (not hot-swap)

We tried hot-swapping plugins at runtime (`sm plugins load/unload`). Problems:
1. **CVars persist** — Surf's `sv_airaccelerate 150` stays after switching to competitive.
2. **game_type can't change at runtime** — Set at launch, enforced by engine.
3. **Plugin state corruption** — SurfTimer's timers, GOKZ's movement hooks, etc. don't clean up properly.

The restart-based approach is clean: write a file, quit server, wrapper picks up the file and restarts with the correct mode. Takes ~5 seconds.

### Why `game_type 3 game_mode 0` for surf/kz/arena

Valve's game modes (Casual, Competitive, DM) have hardcoded behaviors:
- Casual: auto-adds bots, forces warmup, enables vote-on-match-end.
- Competitive: enforces economy, halftime, overtime logic.
- DM: forces DM spawns (actually useful for DM, broken for everything else).

`game_type 3 game_mode 0` (Custom) gives clean control — no engine-forced behaviors, all cvars configurable.

**Exception:** DM must use `game_type 1 game_mode 2` because the engine only places DM spawns in that mode.

### Why `+servercfgfile` not `+exec`

`+exec` runs a config once at boot. But Valve's `gamemode_*.cfg` runs on every map change and overrides your settings. `+servercfgfile` replaces the server config entirely for that session, so your mode config persists across map changes.

For competitive, we don't use `+servercfgfile` — instead, `gamemode_competitive_server.cfg` runs automatically on every map change (engine loads it by naming convention).

### Why wrapper + start.sh (not just systemd restart)

systemd's `Restart=on-failure` restarts with the same arguments. But mode switching needs different arguments (`start.sh surf` vs `start.sh dm`). The wrapper script:
1. Reads `pendingmode.txt` to know what mode was requested
2. Writes `currentmode.txt` so the modeswitch plugin knows the active mode
3. Calls `start.sh` with the correct mode
4. Auto-restarts on exit (3-second delay)

systemd manages the wrapper, which manages start.sh, which manages srcds.
